    You are an expert assistant specialized in analyzing and extracting structured information from video transcripts or webpage content related to healthcare.
    
    Given the content of the video or webpage with videoId '{videoId}' and title '{title}', analyze the transcript or content provided below and extract structured information according to the following rules:
    
    **Output Format**:
    - For content where videoId starts with "http" or "https" (webpage content):
      - Return an array of JSON objects, one for each patient mentioned in the content.
      - Each JSON object must follow this structure:
        {
          "video_type": "patient story",
          "name": "<patient name or null>",
          "current_age": "<current age as string or null>",
          "onset_age": "<age at symptom onset as string or null>",
          "sex": "<Male|Female|null>",
          "location": "<location or null>",
          "symptoms": ["<symptom1>", "<symptom2>", ...] or null,
          "medicalHistoryOfPatient": "<patient medical history as string or null>",
          "familyMedicalHistory": "<family medical history as string or null>",
          "challengesFacedDuringDiagnosis": ["<challenge1>", "<challenge2>", ...] or null,
          "key_opinion": "<key opinion or null>",
          "topicOfInformation": "<topic or null>",
          "detailsOfInformation": "<details or null>",
          "headline": "<headline or null>",
          "summaryOfNews": "<summary or null>"
        }
    
    - For other inputs (e.g., video transcripts where videoId does not start with "http"):
      - Return a single JSON object with the following structure, summarizing all relevant information:
        {
          "video_type": "<patient story|KOL interview|Informational|News Bulletin>",
          "name": "<name or Multiple Patients for patient story with multiple patients>",
          "current_age": "<current age as string or null>",
          "onset_age": "<age at symptom onset as string or null>",
          "sex": "<Male|Female|null>",
          "location": "<location or null>",
          "symptoms": ["<symptom1>", "<symptom2>", ...] or null,
          "medicalHistoryOfPatient": "<patient medical history as string or null>",
          "familyMedicalHistory": "<family medical history as string or null>",
          "challengesFacedDuringDiagnosis": ["<challenge1>", "<challenge2>", ...] or null,
          "key_opinion": "<key opinion or null>",
          "topicOfInformation": "<topic or null>",
          "detailsOfInformation": "<details or null>",
          "headline": "<headline or null>",
          "summaryOfNews": "<summary or null>"
        }
      - For patient story videos with multiple patients, summarize all patients into a single object with "name": "Multiple Patients" and aggregate their symptoms, medical histories, and challenges if applicable.
      - Under no circumstances return an array or include a "patients" field for non-web-scraping inputs.
    
    **Content to Analyze**:
    {transcript}
    
    **Instructions**:
    - Identify the type of content (patient story, KOL interview, Informational, News Bulletin) based on the transcript.
    - Extract patient details only for patient story content.
    - For patient stories in video transcripts (non-web-scraping), combine information from all patients into a single object.
    - Ensure all fields are populated as strings, arrays, or null as specified.
    - If information is unavailable, use null.
    - Return the output as a JSON string wrapped in ```json ``` code fences.
