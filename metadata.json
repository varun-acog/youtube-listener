The National Ataxia Foundation is proud to host this webinar presented by Dr. David Lynch on March 6th, 2023. In \"All About Friedreich's Ataxia\", he gave an overview of the causes and symptoms of the disease, the typical diagnostic journey for those affected, and what to expect for clinical care. \n\nFor more on FA, register for our upcoming webinar on Friday, March 17 here: https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/1416730296018/WN__Zv0QY7PTJCldiH0826dvg\n\nFor more information on Ataxia, please visit our website: https://www.ataxia.org \n\nBecome a Free NAF member! https://bit.ly/JoinNAF\n\nFollow us on Social Media!\nNAF Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/ataxiafounda... \nNAF Twitter:  https://twitter.com/NAF_Ataxia \nNAF Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ataxiafound... \nAtaxia Subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/ataxia/ \n\nAbout the Speaker:\n\nDr. David Lynch obtained a BS in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry at Yale and an MD and PhD in Neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University. He maintains a dynamic program focused on the rare disease Friedreich's ataxia (FA). More specifically, the research led by Dr. Lynch spans clinical, translational, and basic science research efforts on FA that include conducting double-blind clinical trials, identifying biomarkers, and leading mechanistic studies in animal and cellular models of FA. The research conducted by Dr. Lynch and his lab team have led to a greater understanding of the metabolic dysfunction underlying FA. Their work has led to the creation of a patient database as well as a pipeline of more than 20 drug candidates that represent potential new therapies. \n\nAbout the Series:\n\nNAF is producing a series of monthly educational webinars that focus on one type of Ataxia at a time. Each month we will feature a different type. Clinical experts will join us to take a look at the causes and symptoms of the disease, the typical diagnostic journey for those affected, and what to expect for clinical care. Research experts will teach us how the disease is studied and give an overview of the current state of research and drug development.",

    "description": "R. Nolan Townsend, Chief Executive Officer of Lexeo Therapeutics, discusses why diagnosis of Friedreich’s ataxia can be delayed and how the disease tends to progress.\n\nFriedreich’s ataxia is a degenerative neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the FXN gene which reduces the production of frataxin, a protein important for proper mitochondrial functions. The onset of symptoms varies greatly among patients but generally occurs between the ages of 5 to 18 years. Some of the more common symptoms include ataxia, fatigue, scoliosis, diabetes mellitus, and various heart conditions, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias. \n\nMr. Tendsend notes that, like for many rare diseases, a diagnosis of Friedreich’s ataxia can take a long time. Additionally, he notes that there is a misconception that multiple forms of this disorder exist since the treatment landscape for it tends to be focused on improving neurological function or improving cardiac function. Rather than being two distinct forms, the presence of neurologic and/or cardiovascular symptoms are the result of the disease progressing. As Mr. Townsend explains, Friedreich’s ataxia reduces energy production in mitochondria and the brain and heart require the most energy and are thus heavily implicated in the disease. Mr. Townsend additionally notes that the neurologic symptoms tend to appear before the cardiac ones.\n\nTo learn more about Friedreich’s ataxia and other rare neurological disorders, visit checkrare.com/diseases/neurology",

    "description": "Friedreich ataxia is an inherited disease that damages your nervous system. The damage affects your spinal cord and the nerves that control muscle movement in your arms and legs. Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 5 and 15. The main symptom is ataxia, which means trouble coordinating movements. Specific symptoms include:\n\n    Difficulty walking\n    Muscle weakness\n    Speech problems\n    Involuntary eye movements\n    Scoliosis (curving of the spine to one side)\n    Heart palpitations, from the heart disease which can happen along with Friedreich ataxia\n\nPeople with Friedreich ataxia usually need a wheelchair 15 to 20 years after symptoms first appear. In severe cases, people become incapacitated. There is no cure. You can treat symptoms with medicines, braces, surgery, and physical therapy.\n\nNIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke",

Initially, this was put down to adolescence - but at eighteen he was diagnosed with a rare genetic disease called Friedreich’s Ataxia (FA).\n\nFA is a degenerative disease that affects people in different ways. For Dillon, it has made his speech slurred and made walking progressively more difficult - he now uses a wheelchair. \n\nDillon has been through some dark times confronting what FA means to his life.

She slowly began to realize that she needed to be the person and voice that she didn’t have when she was diagnosed.\n\nBy sharing her story on social media, it was a way to not only process her diagnosis but also turn something terrible into action. Now, over 10 years after her diagnosis, Kelly is a blogger and YouTuber with over 300,000 TikTok followers who shares her journey with Friedreich's Ataxia to help others feel less alone.\n\nVisit: http://www.thebalancingact.com\r\nLike: https://www.facebook.com/TheBalancingActFans\r\nFollow: https://twitter.com/BalancingActTV\r\n\r\n#TheBalancingAct #BalancingAct\n107523",

    "description": "R. Nolan Townsend, Chief Executive Officer of Lexeo Therapeutics, discusses the Rare Pediatric Disease designation and Orphan Drug designation granted to LX2006 for the treatment of cardiomyopathy associated with Friedreich’s ataxia.\n\nFriedreich’s ataxia is a degenerative neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the FXN gene which reduces the production of frataxin, a protein important for proper mitochondrial functions. The onset of symptoms varies greatly among patients but generally occurs between the ages of 5 to 18 years. Some of the more common symptoms include ataxia, fatigue, scoliosis, diabetes mellitus, and various heart conditions, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias. Currently, there is no approved treatment for Friedreich’s ataxia. \n\nLX2006 is an IV-administered, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy encoding the human frataxin gene. The designations granted to LX2006 cover cardiac disease and broader symptoms associated with FA.\n\nAs Mr. Townsend explains, Lexeo has been partnered with the Friedreich’s Ataxia Research Alliance (FARA) and will continue this partnership throughout the clinical trial process. Lexeo is planning on submitting an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) this year with the hope of an approval by the end of the year. Assuming the IND is approved, a phase 1/2 clinical trial of LX2006 is likely to begin recruiting by early 2022.\n\nTo learn more about Friedreich’s ataxia and other rare neurological disorders, visit checkrare.com/diseases/neurology",

When delivering healthcare solutions for individuals with speech disabilities, we meet a lot of extraordinary people who have had to re-evaluate how they live their lives without the ability to speak.\n\nThis time, we met Joseph Boon, a New Zealander. He was diagnosed with Friedreich's Ataxia along with his brother and sister. Despite the very unpleasant prognosis, Joseph and his family wanted to find ways to improve their quality of life.\n\n“I work hard to maintain the ability to communicate because it’s more important to me than almost anything else, even the ability to walk. But, just like walking, my voice will keep being challenged until I run out of ways to adapt. That is what brought me to Respeecher,” Joseph explained.\n\nRead the entire story on our website: https://www.respeecher.com/respeecher-revives-communication-capabilities-patient-friedreichs-ataxia",

    "description": "The FA Global Patient Registry transitioned to a new platform in the Fall of 2019. The main purposes of the FA Global Patient Registry have always been to understand where people with FA are living and to provide a platform that facilitates research, globally.\n\nThis registry is only for people diagnosed with Friedreich's ataxia. Parents of minors diagnosed with FA can register an account on behalf of their children. It is important that we have your current contact information. So, if you have not already set up your account in the new registry, we invite you to join.\n﻿\nThe new registry has expanded survey forms to collect information about symptoms and experiences living with FA. This information will be used to:\n\n-Understand FA from the point of view of patients and caregivers to facilitate research and guide clinical trial designs.\n-Connect patients and families to opportunities for biomarker research and clinical trials.\n\n--\n\nFriedreich’s ataxia (FA) is a debilitating, life-shortening, degenerative neuro-muscular disorder. About one in 50,000 people in the United States have Friedreich's ataxia.",

    "description": "Stephanie Cherqui, PhD, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, describes a CRISPR-Cas9 gene-edited hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC)-based therapy for Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA), a rare mitochondrial neurodegenerative disorder. The transplantation of wild-type HSPCs into an FRDA mouse model led to the successful prevention of neurodegeneration in the dorsal root ganglia. Given that FRDA is predominantly caused by a GAA repeat expansion mutation within the frataxin gene (FXN), CRISPR-Cas 9 technology was used to excise the GAA expansion mutation from patient-derived HSPCs, resulting in the restoration of frataxin expression. Future research aims to evaluate the clinical potential of this autologous therapy for FRDA. This interview took place during the American Society for Cell & Gene Therapy 24th Annual Meeting 2021.",

    "description": "Friedreich's Ataxia Explained: Causes, Symptoms, & Management Options [RARE DISEASE]\nAre you or someone you know experiencing progressive difficulty with movement and coordination? This video explores Friedreich's ataxia (FA), a genetic disorder affecting balance and coordination.\n\nWe'll break down the  genetics of FA, including the mutated gene and its impact on frataxin production. You'll learn how frataxin deficiency damages mitochondria, the cell's powerhouses, leading to various symptoms.\n\nCommon symptoms of FA include:\n\nLoss of balance and coordination (ataxia)\nDifficulty walking\nSlurred speech (dysarthria)\nScoliosis (curvature of the spine)\nHigh-arched feet (pes cavus)\nWe'll also explore how FA affects different nerve tracts, causing specific symptoms.\n\nThe video covers diagnosis methods and explains why there's currently no cure. However, we'll discuss treatment options focused on managing symptoms and improving quality of life.\n\nGenetic counseling is crucial for families with a history of FA.\n\nBy raising awareness, we can help the FA community.\n\nLeave a comment below if you have questions about Friedreich's ataxia.\n\n#FriedreichsAtaxia #FA #Genetics #RareDisease #MovementDisorder",

We observed that exogenous antioxidants derived from H. erinaceus could play a key role in reinforcing the endogenous antioxidant defence system to combat oxidative stress in a cellular model of FRDA. Additionally, restoration of mitochondrial function and biogenesis attenuated apoptotic cell death. Therefore, H. erinaceus potentially mitigates oxidative stress in FRDA.\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Wong Kah Hui (Department of Anatomy, FOM)\nModerator: Prof. Dr. Murali Naidu (Department of Anatomy, FOM)\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nBreakfast@UMHealth Producer & Director:\nDr. Shams Amir\nHead, \nVisibility, Information and Communications Unit,\nFaculty of Medicine, UM\n\n#umhealth #facultyofmedicine #medicineum #facultyofdentistry #facultyofpharmacy \n\nhttps://medicine.um.edu.my/",

Some people like playing an active role in improving our understanding of ataxia by participating in clinical trials and other research studies.\n\nHowever, participating in research is a deeply personal choice. There are a lot of things to consider. Things to consider about research studies include the potential risks and benefits, the procedures involved, where the study is taking place, and how much time it takes to be a participant.\n\nBut how do you learn more about what research studies are happening? You can find up-to-date information on research opportunities on the Participate in Ataxia Research page of the National Ataxia Foundation website. Here you can find: \n· Listings of clinical trials and research studies actively looking for ataxia patient participants\n· How to join the CoRDS Ataxia Patient Registry, a confidential list of ataxia patients and unaffected family members who are interested in being contacted about upcoming clinical trials or studies\n· How to enroll in the NAF Brain Donation Program, which is one way to leave a legacy gift to advance ataxia research after your passing.\n\nFor more information on Ataxia, please visit our website: https://www.ataxia.org \n\nBecome a Free NAF member! https://bit.ly/JoinNAF\n\nFollow us on Social Media!\nNAF Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/ataxiafounda... \nNAF Twitter:  https://twitter.com/NAF_Ataxia \nNAF Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ataxiafound... \nAtaxia Subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/ataxia/",

A later onset is usually associated with a less severe course.\nA neurologist will use several tests to reach a diagnosis of F A . Typically, diagnosis begins with a basic physical exam and a careful assessment of personal and family history. During the physical exam, the neurologist is likely to devote special time and attention to testing reflexes, including the knee-jerk reflex.",

If so, this video is for you! \nJoin Andrew Marshall, author of \"Dissecting Wobbles: This is just how I roll,\" as he embarks on a journey to improve his mobility and flexibility. Guided by the expert knowledge of Devan, a professional Biokineticist from Adjustability Justin Jeffery Biokineticists, Andrew will demonstrate a series of targeted stretches designed to combat the effects of prolonged wheelchair use.\nProlonged sitting can lead to muscle shortening and increased muscle contractions, particularly in the hip area. These \"adjusted hip stretches\" are specifically tailored to address these challenges. By lengthening tight muscles and improving flexibility, these stretches can help to enhance overall comfort, reduce pain, and potentially improve mobility.\nScientific research has shown that stretching can be beneficial for individuals with limited mobility by increasing range of motion, reducing muscle stiffness, and improving circulation.\nWe invite you to join Andrew as he explores these stretches and shares his experience. Remember, every journey is unique, and it's essential to listen to your body. If you have any questions or concerns, please consult with your healthcare provider.\nLet's move together!\n\nAdditional Resources:\nThe Wobbles Project: https://www.wobblesproject.com/\nThe Wobbles Project Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/TheWobblesProject\nThe Wobbles Project Buy me a coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/TheWobblesProject\nDissecting Wobbles Website: https://www.dissectingwobbles.co.za/\nDissecting Wobbles: https://www.facebook.com/dissectwobbles\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thewobblesproject/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheWobblesProject/\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Dissecting-Wobbles-Thisjustrollebook/dp/B07N19MDNZ\nGoodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40911272-dissecting-wobbles\nJelly Bottle Media: https://www.jellybottlemedia.com/\nMuscular Dystrophy Foundation of South Africa: https://www.mdsa.org.za/\nRare Diseases South Africa: https://www.rarediseases.co.za/\n@adjustability_biokinetics \n Adjustability (Bio-kineticist): https://adjustability.co.za/ \n@mdf_musculardystrophysa \nMuscular Dystrophy Foundation of South Africa: https://www.mdsa.org.za/ \n \nHealthcare | Rare Diseases South Africa | Charity \n \nRare Diseases South Africa: https://www.rarediseases.co.za/ \nEmail: info@rarediseases.co.za \nTel: +2710 594 3844 \nHotline:  072 476 7552  \nRare Diseases South Africa Facebook: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/rarediseasessa/  \n\n@mdaorg \nMuscular Dystrophy Association: https://www.mda.org/ \n\n@mdf_musculardystrophysa  \nMuscular Dystrophy Foundation of South Africa: https://www.mdsa.org.za/ \nTel: 011 472-9703 \nEmail: gmnational@mdsa.org.za\n#FA | #NeurologicalDisorder | #Exercise | #Physiotherapy | #QualityofLife | \n#FriedreichsAtaxia | #FAAwareness | #exerciseforfa | #ataxiawarriors | #dissectingwobbles | \n#biokineticssouthafrica | #exerciseroutine | #somaticsymptoms | #MobilityMatters | \n#chronicillnesswarrior | #rarediseaseawareness | #thewobblesproject | #documentingwobbles | #neuromusculardisorders",

    "description": "WHAT IS ATAXIA\nHOW DO YOU DIAGNOSE ATAXIA\n#ataxia \nAtaxia describes poor muscle control that causes clumsy voluntary movements. It may cause difficulty with walking and balance, hand coordination, speech and swallowing, and eye movements.\nATAXIA\nAtaxia usually results from damage to the part of the brain that controls muscle coordination (cerebellum) or its connections. Many conditions can cause ataxia, including alcohol misuse, stroke, tumor, brain degeneration, multiple sclerosis, certain medications and genetic disorders.\nTreatment for ataxia depends on the cause. Adaptive devices, such as walkers or canes, might help maintain independence. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and regular aerobic exercise also might help.\nAtaxia can develop over time or come on suddenly. Ataxia is a sign of several neurological disorders and can cause:\nPoor coordination\nWalking unsteadily or with the feet set wide apart\nPoor balance\nDifficulty with fine motor tasks, such as eating, writing or buttoning a shirt\nChange in speech\nInvoluntary back-and-forth eye movements (nystagmus)\nDifficulty swallowing\n Damage to the part of your brain that controls muscle coordination (cerebellum) or its connections can cause ataxia. The cerebellum, located at the base of the brain, connects to the brainstem. The cerebellum helps control balance, eye movements, swallowing and speech. There are three major groups of ataxia causes: acquired, degenerative disease and hereditary causes.\nAlcohol. Long-term excess alcohol intake may cause persistent ataxia. It's possible it may improve by avoiding alcohol completely.\nMedications. Ataxia is a potential side effect of certain medications, especially barbiturates, such as phenobarbital; sedatives, such as benzodiazepines; antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin; and some types of chemotherapy.\nToxins. Heavy metal poisoning, such as from lead or mercury, and solvent poisoning, such as from paint thinner, also can cause ataxia.\nVitamins. Not getting enough vitamin E, vitamin B-1, vitamin B-12 or thiamine can lead to ataxia. A deficiency or excess of Vitamin B-6 deficiency also may cause ataxia. These causes are important to identify because ataxia caused by these deficiencies can often be reversed.\nThyroid problems. Hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism can cause ataxia.\nStroke. Sudden onset of ataxia occurs with a stroke. This may be either due to a blood vessel blockage or bleeding on the brain.\nMultiple sclerosis. This neurological disorder may cause ataxia.\nAutoimmune diseases. Sarcoidosis, celiac disease, certain types of encephalomyelitis and other autoimmune diseases may cause ataxia.\nInfections. Ataxia can be an uncommon complication of chickenpox in childhood, and other viral infections such as HIV and Lyme disease. It might appear in the healing stages of the infection and last for days or weeks. Normally, the symptoms get better over time.\nCOVID-19 infection. Ataxia most commonly results from severe COVID-19 cases.\nParaneoplastic syndromes. These are rare degenerative disorders triggered by the immune system response to a cancerous tumor (neoplasm), most commonly from lung, ovarian or breast cancer or lymphoma. Ataxia can appear months or years before the cancer is diagnosed.\nAbnormalities in the brain. An infected area (abscess) in the brain may cause ataxia. A growth on the brain, a cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign) tumor, can damage the cerebellum.\nHead trauma. Severe brain damage may cause cerebellar ataxia weeks to months after the trauma.\nCerebral palsy. This is a general term for a group of disorders caused by damage to a child's brain during early development — before, during or shortly after birth — that affects the child's ability to coordinate body movements.\nSpinocerebellar ataxias. Researchers have identified more than 40 autosomal dominant ataxia genes, and the number continues to grow. Cerebellar ataxia and cerebellar degeneration are common to all types, and there may be other neurological signs and symptoms.\nEpisodic ataxia (EA). There are eight recognized types of ataxia that are episodic rather than progressive — EA1 through EA7, plus late-onset episodic ataxia. EA1 and EA2 are the most common.\nFriedreich's ataxia. This is the most common hereditary ataxia. It involves damage to the cerebellum, spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves carry signals from the arms and legs to the brain and spinal cord. In most cases, signs and symptoms appear well before age 25. The cerebellum usually appears normal on a brain scan.\nAtaxia-telangiectasia. This rare, progressive childhood disease causes degeneration in the brain and the immune system. This increases the risk of other diseases, including infections and tumors.\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ataxia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355652#:~:text=Ataxia%20describes%20poor%20muscle%20control,and%20swallowing%2C%20and%20eye%20movements.",

It may cause difficulty with walking and balance, hand coordination, speech and swallowing, and eye movements.\n\nAtaxia usually results from damage to the part of the brain that controls muscle coordination (cerebellum) or its connections. Many conditions can cause ataxia, including alcohol misuse, stroke, tumor, brain degeneration, multiple sclerosis, certain medications and genetic disorders.\n\nTreatment for ataxia depends on the cause. Adaptive devices, such as walkers or canes, might help maintain independence. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and regular aerobic exercise also might help.\n\nFACEBOOK | https://www.facebook.com/m.hady11\nTWITTER | https://twitter.com/mha_dy11\n\nThanks for watching",

Of special note to Ron is that he was able to be a part of the negotiation team for the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty between The United States and The Soviet Union. As a school kid, Ron dreamed of being able to know enough about global superpowers that he would be able to help orchestrate peace between the US and the Soviet Union. After an impressive military career, he was a part of the INF Treaty, which helped put an end to the Cold War. \n\nFARA: https://curefa.org\n\n--\nThe Two Disabled Dudes Podcast is about cultivating the courage to live beyond any circumstance & laugh along the way.

This podcast is presented to you by Rare Disease Review, a student run not-for-profit medical journal with students from University of Toronto, McMaster and Western University.\n\nOur topic for this episode is Friedreich's Ataxia. In this episode, we are going to dive into a rare hereditary disease called Friedreich’s ataxia. Friedreich’s ataxia is a genetic, progressive, neurodegenerative movement disorder. To better understand the scientific research on Friedreich’s ataxia, we spoke with Dr. Vy Ngo, a PhD graduate from the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Western University. Dr. Ngo focused her studies on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of oxidative stress which, in Friedrich’s ataxia, is an important contributing factor in the progression of the disease.\n\nFor further details, please visit our website www.rarediseasereview.ca\nFacebook: raredrev\nInstagram: rdrwestern\nTwitter: raredrev",

    "description": "Ataxia: Navigating the Challenges of Uncoordinated Movement**\n\nAtaxia is a neurological disorder characterized by the impairment of voluntary muscle coordination. This condition affects various parts of the nervous system, leading to unsteady gait, difficulties with balance, and problems with fine motor skills. Understanding the symptoms, types, and causes of ataxia is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management.\n\n**Symptoms of Ataxia:**\n\n1. **Gait Disturbances:** Individuals with ataxia often exhibit an unsteady or staggering gait. Walking may appear clumsy, and there can be a lack of coordination in leg movements.\n\n2. **Poor Coordination:** Ataxia can affect coordination in both gross and fine motor skills. Simple tasks like writing, buttoning a shirt, or picking up small objects may become challenging.\n\n3. **Balance Issues:** Maintaining balance becomes difficult, leading to an increased risk of falls. Individuals with ataxia may sway or lurch unpredictably.\n\n4. **Speech Problems:** Ataxia can affect the muscles involved in speech, resulting in slurred or slow speech patterns.\n\n5. **Eye Movement Abnormalities:** Some forms of ataxia may cause abnormal eye movements, such as nystagmus (involuntary eye movements).\n\n6. **Tremors:** Tremors, particularly in the limbs, may be present in certain types of ataxia.\n\n7. **Difficulty Swallowing:** Coordinated swallowing can be impaired, leading to difficulties in eating and increased risk of choking.\n\nThese symptoms can vary in severity and may progress over time. The underlying cause of ataxia often determines the specific combination of symptoms experienced by an individual.\n\n **Types of Ataxia:**\n\n1. **Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA):**\n   - A group of inherited ataxias characterized by progressive degeneration of the cerebellum.\n   - There are various subtypes (e.g., SCA1, SCA2), each associated with a specific genetic mutation.\n\n2. **Friedreich's Ataxia:**\n   - An autosomal recessive genetic disorder causing degeneration in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves.\n   - Typically diagnosed in childhood or adolescence, it leads to gait instability, speech difficulties, and cardiac issues.\n\n3. **Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T):**\n   - A rare genetic disorder affecting multiple systems, including the cerebellum, immune system, and skin.\n   - Individuals with A-T often have weakened immune function and an increased risk of developing certain cancers.\n\n4. **Idiopathic Late-Onset Cerebellar Ataxia ILOCA:**\n   - Onset of ataxia occurs later in life without an identifiable genetic cause.\n   - It is considered idiopathic when the cause remains unknown.\n\n5. **Cerebral Ataxia:\n   - Results from damage to the cerebellum due to factors such as stroke, tumors, or multiple sclerosis.\n   - Symptoms depend on the location and extent of the brain damage.\n\n6. **Toxic and Metabolic Ataxia:\n   - Caused by exposure to certain toxins, medications, or metabolic disorders affecting the nervous system.\n   - Alcohol-related ataxia is an example of toxic ataxia.\n\n7. **Traumatic Ataxia:\n   - Caused by head injuries or trauma affecting the cerebellum or other parts of the nervous system involved in coordination.\n\n**Causes of Ataxia:\n\n1. **Genetic Factors:\n   - Many types of ataxia, such as spinocerebellar ataxias, are inherited and result from genetic mutations.\n\n2. **Brain Damage or Injury:**\n   - Traumatic brain injury, stroke, tumors, or other conditions causing damage to the cerebellum or associated pathways can lead to ataxia.\n\n3. **Toxins and Medications:**\n   - Prolonged exposure to certain toxins, such as heavy metals, or the use of specific medications e.g., anti-seizure drugs can induce ataxia.\n\n4. **Metabolic Disorders:**\n   - Conditions affecting metabolism, like vitamin deficiencies particularly vitamin B12 can result in ataxia.\n\n5. Autoimmune Disorders:\n   - Autoimmune diseases, where the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's tissues, may lead to ataxia.\n\n\n#drkukrejakalani \n#kenthomeopathypowai\n#onlineconsultation \n#8291492566\n\n#ataxiaawareness #balanceissue #speechproblem#tremore #difficultyswallowing #poorcoordination #ataxia \n\n\nKent Homeopathy clinic is a Homeopathy clinic located at Hiranandani Gardens, Powai, Mumbai.\nConsult with Dr Kukreja A Kalani MD(Homeopathy) by visiting the clinic or via a secure Video Consultation.\nTo book an In clinic appointment or to consult via video please call or WhatsApp on +91-8291492566 \n\n\nVisit Kent Homeopathy clinic Powai: \nhttp://kenthomeopathy.com\n\nTo\nBook an In-clinic appointment with Dr Kukreja A Kalani:\nhttps://kenthomeopathy.com/book-appointnment/#inclinic\n\nTo\nBook an Online Video Consult with Dr Kukreja A Kalani:\nhttps://kenthomeopathy.com/book-appointnment/\n\nLike Kent Homeopathy clinic Powai on Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/kenthomeopathyclinic?mibextid=JRoKGi\n\nFollow Kent Homeopathy clinic Powai on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/kenthomeopathyclinicpowai?igsh=MWptMXIxYzBucnJ3ZQ%3D%3D&utm_source=qr",

    "description": "Are you living with Friedreich's Ataxia or another neuromuscular disorder? Discover how targeted exercises can make a significant difference in your strength and overall well-being. In this video, Andrew Marshall, author of \"Dissecting Wobbles: This is just how I roll,\" demonstrates adjusted leg presses with the expert guidance of Devan, a certified Biokineticist from Adjustability – Justin Jeffery Biokineticists.\n*Why are leg presses important?*\nFor individuals with Friedreich's Ataxia and other neuromuscular disorders, maintaining lower body strength is crucial for preserving independence and improving quality of life. Leg presses, when adjusted to suit specific needs, can help:\n• *Increase muscle strength:* Regular exercise helps to build and maintain muscle mass, counteracting the muscle weakness associated with these conditions.\n• *Improve balance and stability:* Stronger leg muscles contribute to better balance and reduce the risk of falls.\n• *Enhance functional abilities:* Stronger legs can make everyday tasks like standing, walking, and climbing stairs easier.\n• *Boost overall well-being:* Physical activity has been shown to improve mood, energy levels, and sleep quality.\nDevan, a skilled Biokineticist, explains the science behind these exercises and how they can be tailored to individual needs. Together, Andrew and Devan provide clear and encouraging demonstrations, ensuring that everyone can participate at their own pace.\n\nJoin us as we explore the benefits of adjusted leg presses and discover how these exercises can empower you to live a more fulfilling life. Remember, every step, no matter how small, is a *victory.*\n\nDon't forget to like, share, and subscribe for more helpful content.\n• Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise program, especially if you have a neuromuscular disorder.\n \nAdditional Resources:\nThe Wobbles Project: https://www.wobblesproject.com/\nThe Wobbles Project Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/TheWobblesProject\nThe Wobbles Project Buy me a coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/TheWobblesProject\nDissecting Wobbles Website: https://www.dissectingwobbles.co.za/\nDissecting Wobbles: https://www.facebook.com/dissectwobbles\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thewobblesproject/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheWobblesProject/\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Dissecting-Wobbles-Thisjustrollebook/dp/B07N19MDNZ\nGoodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40911272-dissecting-wobbles\nJelly Bottle Media: https://www.jellybottlemedia.com/\nMuscular Dystrophy Foundation of South Africa: https://www.mdsa.org.za/\nRare Diseases South Africa: https://www.rarediseases.co.za/ \n@adjustability_biokinetics \n Adjustability (Bio-kineticist): https://adjustability.co.za/ \n@mdf_musculardystrophysa \nMuscular Dystrophy Foundation of South Africa: https://www.mdsa.org.za/ \n \nHealthcare | Rare Diseases South Africa | Charity \n \nRare Diseases South Africa: https://www.rarediseases.co.za/ \nEmail: info@rarediseases.co.za \nTel: +2710 594 3844 \nHotline:  072 476 7552  \nRare Diseases South Africa Facebook: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/rarediseasessa/  \n\n@mdaorg \nMuscular Dystrophy Association: https://www.mda.org/ \n\n@mdf_musculardystrophysa  \nMuscular Dystrophy Foundation of South Africa: https://www.mdsa.org.za/ \nTel: 011 472-9703 \nEmail: gmnational@mdsa.org.za\n\n#faawareness | #NeurologicalDisorder | #Exercise | #Physiotherapy | #QualityofLife | #FriedreichsAtaxia | #FAAwareness | #exerciseforfa | #ataxiawarriors | #dissectingwobbles | #biokineticssouthafrica | #exerciseroutine | #somaticsymptoms | #MobilityMatters | #chronicillnesswarrior | #rarediseaseawareness | #thewobblesproject | #documentingwobbles | #neuromusculardisorders",

    "description": "Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is a rare, inherited degenerative disease that affects the nervous system and the heart. It is caused by mutations in the FXN gene, which encodes a protein called frataxin. This protein is crucial for mitochondrial function, particularly in energy production and iron homeostasis.\n\n#medicine \n# Key Features:\n\n1. Neurological Symptoms\n   - Progressive ataxia loss of coordination and balance\n   - Muscle weakness\n   - Sensory loss difficulty feeling vibrations or position\n   - Scoliosis curvature of the spine\n\n2. **Cardiac Issues**:\n   - Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy thickening of the heart muscle\n   - Arrhythmias irregular heartbeats\n\n3. **Diabetes**: Some individuals may develop diabetes mellitus.\n\n4. **Vision and Hearing**: Some patients may experience vision or hearing impairments.\n\n### Diagnosis:\nFA is typically diagnosed through clinical evaluation, family history, and genetic testing to identify mutations in the FXN gene. MRI scans may show changes in the spinal cord and brain.\n\n### Treatment:\nCurrently, there is no cure for Friedreich's ataxia. Management focuses on alleviating symptoms and improving quality of life, which may include:\n\n- Physical therapy\n- Occupational therapy\n- Speech therapy\n- Medications for managing symptoms (e.g., muscle spasticity)\n\n### Prognosis:\nThe progression of FA varies among individuals, but it generally leads to significant disability over time. Most affected individuals eventually require assistance with daily activities.\n\nResearch is ongoing to explore potential therapies, including gene therapy and treatments aimed at improving mitochondrial function.",

This conditions tends to develop in children and teens and gradually worsens over time.\nSubacute combined degeneration of spinal cord, also known as myelosis funiculus, or funicular myelosis, also Lichtheim's disease and Putnam-Dana syndrome, refers to degeneration of the posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord as a result of vitamin B12 deficiency (most common). It may also occur similarly as result of vitamin E deficiency and copper deficiency. It is usually associated with pernicious anemia.\nTabes dorsalis is a slowly progressive parenchymatous degenerative disease of the dorsal column and dorsal root of the spinal cord as a result of syphilis caused by infection with Treponema pallidum pallidum, one of three subspecies of Treponema pallidum that can cause sexually transmitted disease in humans.",

This podcast is presented to you by Rare Disease Review, a student run not-for-profit medical journal with students from University of Toronto, McMaster and Western University.\n\nOur topic for this episode is Friedreich's Ataxia. In this episode, we are going to dive into a rare hereditary disease called Friedreich’s ataxia. Friedreich’s ataxia is a genetic, progressive, neurodegenerative movement disorder. To better understand the scientific research on Friedreich’s ataxia, we spoke with Dr. Vy Ngo, a PhD graduate from the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Western University. Dr. Ngo focused her studies on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of oxidative stress which, in Friedrich’s ataxia, is an important contributing factor in the progression of the disease.\n\nFor further details, please visit our website www.rarediseasereview.ca\nFacebook: raredrev\nInstagram: rdrwestern\nTwitter: raredrev",

Scott was diagnosed with Friedreich's ataxia in 1994 at the age of 12. \n\n\nFriedreich's ataxia is an inherited disorder that affects some of the body's nerves. It is caused by a gene defect that is inherited from both parents. Symptoms generally start between 5 and 20 years of age and can include trouble walking, fatigue, changes in sensation, and slowed speech. \n\nFor more information on FA:\nVisit: https://curefa.org\n\nFor more information on make and model of equipment leave a comment.

    "description": "Are you living with Friedreich's Ataxia or another neuromuscular disorder? Discover how targeted exercises can make a significant difference in your strength and overall well-being. In this video, Andrew Marshall, author of \"Dissecting Wobbles: This is just how I roll,\" demonstrates adjusted leg presses with the expert guidance of Devan, a certified Biokineticist from Adjustability – Justin Jeffery Biokineticists.\n*Why are leg presses important?*\nFor individuals with Friedreich's Ataxia and other neuromuscular disorders, maintaining lower body strength is crucial for preserving independence and improving quality of life. Leg presses, when adjusted to suit specific needs, can help:\n• *Increase muscle strength:* Regular exercise helps to build and maintain muscle mass, counteracting the muscle weakness associated with these conditions.\n• *Improve balance and stability:* Stronger leg muscles contribute to better balance and reduce the risk of falls.\n• *Enhance functional abilities:* Stronger legs can make everyday tasks like standing, walking, and climbing stairs easier.\n• *Boost overall well-being:* Physical activity has been shown to improve mood, energy levels, and sleep quality.\nDevan, a skilled Biokineticist, explains the science behind these exercises and how they can be tailored to individual needs. Together, Andrew and Devan provide clear and encouraging demonstrations, ensuring that everyone can participate at their own pace.\n\nJoin us as we explore the benefits of adjusted leg presses and discover how these exercises can empower you to live a more fulfilling life. Remember, every step, no matter how small, is a *victory.*\n\nDon't forget to like, share, and subscribe for more helpful content.\n• Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise program, especially if you have a neuromuscular disorder.\n \nAdditional Resources:\nThe Wobbles Project: https://www.wobblesproject.com/\nThe Wobbles Project Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/TheWobblesProject\nThe Wobbles Project Buy me a coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/TheWobblesProject\nDissecting Wobbles Website: https://www.dissectingwobbles.co.za/\nDissecting Wobbles: https://www.facebook.com/dissectwobbles\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thewobblesproject/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheWobblesProject/\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Dissecting-Wobbles-Thisjustrollebook/dp/B07N19MDNZ\nGoodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40911272-dissecting-wobbles\nJelly Bottle Media: https://www.jellybottlemedia.com/\nMuscular Dystrophy Foundation of South Africa: https://www.mdsa.org.za/\nRare Diseases South Africa: https://www.rarediseases.co.za/ \n@adjustability_biokinetics \n Adjustability (Bio-kineticist): https://adjustability.co.za/ \n@mdf_musculardystrophysa \nMuscular Dystrophy Foundation of South Africa: https://www.mdsa.org.za/ \n \nHealthcare | Rare Diseases South Africa | Charity \n \nRare Diseases South Africa: https://www.rarediseases.co.za/ \nEmail: info@rarediseases.co.za \nTel: +2710 594 3844 \nHotline:  072 476 7552  \nRare Diseases South Africa Facebook: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/rarediseasessa/  \n\n@mdaorg \nMuscular Dystrophy Association: https://www.mda.org/ \n\n@mdf_musculardystrophysa  \nMuscular Dystrophy Foundation of South Africa: https://www.mdsa.org.za/ \nTel: 011 472-9703 \nEmail: gmnational@mdsa.org.za\n\n#faawareness | #NeurologicalDisorder | #Exercise | #Physiotherapy | #QualityofLife | #FriedreichsAtaxia | #FAAwareness | #exerciseforfa | #ataxiawarriors | #dissectingwobbles | #biokineticssouthafrica | #exerciseroutine | #somaticsymptoms | #MobilityMatters | #chronicillnesswarrior | #rarediseaseawareness | #thewobblesproject | #documentingwobbles | #neuromusculardisorders",

    "description": "Walking on toes, also known as toe walking, is a gait pattern where an individual walks on the balls of their feet, with little to no contact from the heel. This can be common in toddlers as they develop their walking skills, but if it persists beyond early childhood, it may warrant further evaluation.\n\nPossible causes of toe walking include:\n\n1. **Developmental Factors**: Many children walk on their toes during the early stages of learning to walk.\n2. **Muscle Tightness**: Tightness in the Achilles tendon or calf muscles can lead to toe walking.\n3. **Neurological Conditions**: Conditions such as cerebral palsy or autism spectrum disorder can also be associated with toe walking.\n4. **Habitual Behavior**: Some children may develop a habit of toe walking without an underlying medical issue.\n\nIf toe walking continues past the age of five or is accompanied by other concerns, consulting a healthcare professional, such as a pediatrician or physical therapist, may be beneficial. They can assess the child's gait and determine if any interventions are necessary.",

    "description": "Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is a rare, inherited degenerative disease that affects the nervous system and the heart. It is caused by mutations in the FXN gene, which encodes a protein called frataxin. This protein is crucial for mitochondrial function, particularly in energy production and iron homeostasis.\n\n#medicine \n# Key Features:\n\n1. Neurological Symptoms\n   - Progressive ataxia loss of coordination and balance\n   - Muscle weakness\n   - Sensory loss difficulty feeling vibrations or position\n   - Scoliosis curvature of the spine\n\n2. **Cardiac Issues**:\n   - Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy thickening of the heart muscle\n   - Arrhythmias irregular heartbeats\n\n3. **Diabetes**: Some individuals may develop diabetes mellitus.\n\n4. **Vision and Hearing**: Some patients may experience vision or hearing impairments.\n\n### Diagnosis:\nFA is typically diagnosed through clinical evaluation, family history, and genetic testing to identify mutations in the FXN gene. MRI scans may show changes in the spinal cord and brain.\n\n### Treatment:\nCurrently, there is no cure for Friedreich's ataxia. Management focuses on alleviating symptoms and improving quality of life, which may include:\n\n- Physical therapy\n- Occupational therapy\n- Speech therapy\n- Medications for managing symptoms (e.g., muscle spasticity)\n\n### Prognosis:\nThe progression of FA varies among individuals, but it generally leads to significant disability over time. Most affected individuals eventually require assistance with daily activities.\n\nResearch is ongoing to explore potential therapies, including gene therapy and treatments aimed at improving mitochondrial function.",

This video showcases how some easy DIY modifications can make life much easier when living with Friedreich’s Ataxia as well as other neuromuscular conditions.\n• Grab Bars: Modifications done with strong curtain rails bolted onto flat surfaces acts as a grab point when you try to get out of the bath.\n• Raised Toilet Chair: An elevated toilet seat makes it easier for Andrew to sit and move around, reducing strain on his back and joints. The seat also helps him not to sink into the toilet seat when using it. The toilet seat rolls over the existing plumbing making it mobility easier.\nAdditional Resources:\n\nAdditional Resources:\nThe Wobbles Project: https://www.wobblesproject.com/\nThe Wobbles Project Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/TheWobblesProject\nThe Wobbles Project Buy me a coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/TheWobblesProject\nDissecting Wobbles Website: https://www.dissectingwobbles.co.za/\nDissecting Wobbles: https://www.facebook.com/dissectwobbles\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thewobblesproject/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheWobblesProject/\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Dissecting-Wobbles-Thisjustrollebook/dp/B07N19MDNZ\nGoodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40911272-dissecting-wobbles\nJelly Bottle Media: https://www.jellybottlemedia.com/\nMuscular Dystrophy Foundation of South Africa: https://www.mdsa.org.za/\nRare Diseases South Africa: https://www.rarediseases.co.za/\n\n#TheWobblesProject | #DocumentingWobbles | #DissectingWobbles | #AccessibilityMatters | #AccessibleDesign | #DisabilityAwareness | #InclusiveLiving | #AdaptiveTechnology | #AssistiveDevices | #HomeAccessibility | #BathroomAccessibility | #HomeRenovation | #BathroomRenovation | #AccessibleBathroom | #AdaptiveDesign | #UniversalDesign | #AgingInPlace | #DisabilityRemodeling | #AccessibleLiving | #IndependentLiving | #DisabilitySupport | #DisabilityEmpowerment | #AccessibilityFeatures | #AdaptiveSolutions | #DisabilityInclusion | #AccessibleHomes | #Friedreich'sAtaxia | #Friedreich'sAtaxiaAwareness | #NeuromuscularDisease | #Disability |  #Accessibility | #AdaptiveEquipment | #DIYModifications | #HomeModifications | #Bathroom | #Safety | #BathroomAccessibility",

    "title": "Post 36 | Living with Friedreich's Ataxia: Bladder Control and Surgical Interventions",
    "description": "Friedreich's ataxia is a rare, inherited neuromuscular disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness and loss of coordination. One of the most common complications of Friedreich's ataxia is bladder dysfunction, which can lead to incontinence, urinary retention, and infections.\n\nIn this video, we will discuss the challenges of bladder control for people with Friedreich's ataxia, as well as a surgical intervention called a suprapubic catheter that can help to manage these problems. We will also talk about the importance of using a plastic urine container when you have a neuromuscular condition.\nChallenges of Bladder Control with Friedreich's Ataxia\n\nPeople with Friedreich's ataxia may experience a variety of bladder control problems, including:\n• Incontinence: This is the involuntary leakage of urine.\n• Urinary retention: This is the inability to empty the bladder completely.\n• Urinary tract infections (UTIs): UTIs are common in people with bladder dysfunction because urine can back up in the bladder and create an environment where bacteria can grow.\n\nSuprapubic Catheter\nA suprapubic catheter is a tube that drains urine from the bladder through a small incision in the lower abdomen. It is an option for people with Friedreich's ataxia who are unable to use an intermittent catheter (a catheter that is inserted and removed periodically).\nBenefits of a Suprapubic Catheter\n• Improved bladder control: A suprapubic catheter can help to prevent incontinence and urinary retention.\n• Reduced risk of UTIs: A suprapubic catheter can help to reduce the risk of UTIs by draining urine from the bladder regularly.\n• Increased independence: A suprapubic catheter can give people with Friedreich's ataxia more independence by allowing them to empty their bladder without relying on others.\nPlastic Urine Containers\nPlastic urine containers are a convenient and discreet way to collect urine. They are available in a variety of sizes and shapes, and they can be used with either a suprapubic catheter or an intermittent catheter.\nBenefits of Plastic Urine Containers\n• Easy to use: Plastic urine containers are easy to use and clean.\n• Discreet: Plastic urine containers are discreet and can be easily hidden under clothing.\n• Affordable: Plastic urine containers are relatively affordable.\n\nConclusion\nBladder control can be a challenging problem for people with Friedreich's ataxia. However, there are a number of treatment options available that can help to manage this condition. If you are living with Friedreich's Ataxia and are having trouble with bladder control, it is important to talk to your doctor about your options.\n\nAdditional Resources:\nThe Wobbles Project: https://www.wobblesproject.com/\nThe Wobbles Project Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/TheWobblesProject\nThe Wobbles Project Buy me a coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/TheWobblesProject\nDissecting Wobbles Website: https://www.dissectingwobbles.co.za/\nDissecting Wobbles: https://www.facebook.com/dissectwobbles\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thewobblesproject/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheWobblesProject/\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Dissecting-Wobbles-Thisjustrollebook/dp/B07N19MDNZ\nGoodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40911272-dissecting-wobbles\nJelly Bottle Media: https://www.jellybottlemedia.com/\nMuscular Dystrophy Foundation of South Africa: https://www.mdsa.org.za/\nRare Diseases South Africa: https://www.rarediseases.co.za/\n\n\n#thewobblesproject | #dissectingwobbles | #documentingwobbles  |#FriedreichsAtaxia | #FA | #neuromusculardisease | #disability | #healthcare | #medicalcondition | #bladdercontrol | #urinaryincontinence | #urinaryretention | #catheterization | #suprapubiccatheter | #qualityoflife | #independence | #patientexperience | #healthtips | #medicaladvice",

This conditions tends to develop in children and teens and gradually worsens over time.\nSubacute combined degeneration of spinal cord, also known as myelosis funiculus, or funicular myelosis, also Lichtheim's disease and Putnam-Dana syndrome, refers to degeneration of the posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord as a result of vitamin B12 deficiency (most common). It may also occur similarly as result of vitamin E deficiency and copper deficiency. It is usually associated with pernicious anemia.\nTabes dorsalis is a slowly progressive parenchymatous degenerative disease of the dorsal column and dorsal root of the spinal cord as a result of syphilis caused by infection with Treponema pallidum pallidum, one of three subspecies of Treponema pallidum that can cause sexually transmitted disease in humans.",

    "title": "Friedreich's Ataxia (FA)",
    "description": "Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the nervous system and the heart. It is characterized by progressive damage to the spinal cord and peripheral nerves, resulting in muscle weakness and loss of coordination (ataxia) over time. FA is caused by mutations in the FXN gene, which leads to reduced production of a protein called frataxin. This protein is essential for the proper functioning of mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells.\n\nKey features and symptoms of Friedreich's ataxia include:\n\n1. **Ataxia**: Progressive loss of coordination and balance, often starting in childhood or adolescence.\n2. **Muscle Weakness**: Gradual weakening of muscles, especially in the legs, leading to difficulty walking.\n3. **Speech Problems**: Slurred speech (dysarthria) and difficulty with fine motor skills.\n4. **Heart Issues**: Cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle, which can lead to heart failure.\n5. **Skeletal Deformities**: Scoliosis (curvature of the spine) and foot deformities such as high arches.\n6. **Diabetes**: Some individuals with FA may develop diabetes mellitus.\n7. **Sensory Loss**: Loss of sensation, particularly in the lower limbs.\n\nFA is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning a person must inherit two copies of the defective gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition. There is currently no cure for Friedreich's ataxia, but various treatments and therapies aim to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. These include physical therapy, medications for heart and diabetes management, and surgical interventions for skeletal deformities. Research is ongoing to find more effective treatments and potentially a cure.\n\nLyrics \n\n￼ (Verse 1)  \nIn a world that seems to blur and fade,  \nWe face the dawn, unafraid.  \nWith eyes that see beyond the night,  \nWe find our way, guided by light.\n\n(Chorus)  \nFriedreich's ataxia, our vision may wane,  \nBut we'll find clarity through the pain.  \nThough the world may dim, our spirit shines bright,  \nWe'll navigate darkness, we'll find our sight.\n\n(Verse 2)  \nShadows may fall, but we stand strong,  \nIn the heart of the struggle, we belong.  \nWith every challenge, with every stare,  \nWe look within, finding strength there.\n\n(Chorus)  \nFriedreich's ataxia, our vision may wane,  \nBut we'll find clarity through the pain.  \nThough the world may dim, our spirit shines bright,  \nWe'll navigate darkness, we'll find our sight.\n\n(Bridge)  \nEyes that see with the heart's true lens,  \nIn every moment, the journey begins.  \nWith faith as our guide, we'll never stray,  \nFinding new paths, day by day.\n\n(Chorus)  \nFriedreich's ataxia, our vision may wane,  \nBut we'll find clarity through the pain.  \nThough the world may dim, our spirit shines bright,  \nWe'll navigate darkness, we'll find our sight.\n\n(Outro)  \nIn the face of fading light, we rise,  \nSeeing the world through different eyes.  \nFriedreich's ataxia, you won't define,  \nThe clarity we hold, the strength we find.",

    "title": "Post 53 | Overcoming Communication Barriers with Large Language Models",
    "description": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing communication for individuals with conditions like Friedreich's Ataxia. The key lies in their training on extensive linguistic datasets. These datasets provide the LLM with a rich understanding of syntax, morphology, and semantics. The benefits extend beyond simple translation. LLMs reduce the cognitive load associated with communication, allowing individuals to focus on the content of their message rather than the mechanics of speech. \nThey also offer increased accessibility, providing a consistent and reliable communication tool that can be used in a variety of settings. Furthermore, these models can be integrated with various devices, offering flexible and adaptable solutions. We explore how the sophisticated linguistic processing within these models is enabling more effective and cohesive communication for Andrew Marshall and others, and how these benefits are transforming lives.\nKey Benefits to Emphasize:\nIncreased Independence: LLMs empower individuals to communicate without constant reliance on others.\nReduced Frustration: Clearer communication minimizes misunderstandings and frustration.\nEnhanced Social Inclusion: Improved communication facilitates meaningful social interactions.\nFaster Communication: LLMs can process and generate responses quickly, improving communication efficiency.\nAccuracy: LLMs can accurately interpret fragmented or altered speech.\nPersonalization: Models can be tailored to individual speech patterns.\nReduced Cognitive Load: LLMs handle the linguistic processing, allowing users to focus on their message.\nIncreased Accessibility: LLMs provide a reliable communication tool in various settings.\nAdaptability: LLMs can be integrated with various devices and platforms.\nImproved Quality of Life: Overall, LLMs contribute to a better quality of life by facilitating effective communication.\nAdditional Resources:\nGet a book: https://www.wobblesproject.com/support-us/ \nThe Wobbles Project: https://www.wobblesproject.com/ \nBuy me a coffee: https://buymeacoffee.com/thewobblesproject/ \nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/TheWobblesProject/ \nIntermarketing: https://www.intermarketingza.co.za/\n Our Socials: \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@TheWobblesProject/ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thewobblesproject/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thewobblesproject/\n\n#TheWobblesProject | #WobblesProject | #assistivetech | #FriedreichsAtaxia | #AIforgood | #TechForGood | #GenerativeAI | #AIInnovation | #Intermarketingza | #Intermarketing",
