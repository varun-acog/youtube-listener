    "title": "Post 53 | Overcoming Communication Barriers with Large Language Models",
    "description": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing communication for individuals with conditions like Friedreich's Ataxia. The key lies in their training on extensive linguistic datasets. These datasets provide the LLM with a rich understanding of syntax, morphology, and semantics. The benefits extend beyond simple translation. LLMs reduce the cognitive load associated with communication, allowing individuals to focus on the content of their message rather than the mechanics of speech. \nThey also offer increased accessibility, providing a consistent and reliable communication tool that can be used in a variety of settings. Furthermore, these models can be integrated with various devices, offering flexible and adaptable solutions. We explore how the sophisticated linguistic processing within these models is enabling more effective and cohesive communication for Andrew Marshall and others, and how these benefits are transforming lives.\nKey Benefits to Emphasize:\nIncreased Independence: LLMs empower individuals to communicate without constant reliance on others.\nReduced Frustration: Clearer communication minimizes misunderstandings and frustration.\nEnhanced Social Inclusion: Improved communication facilitates meaningful social interactions.\nFaster Communication: LLMs can process and generate responses quickly, improving communication efficiency.\nAccuracy: LLMs can accurately interpret fragmented or altered speech.\nPersonalization: Models can be tailored to individual speech patterns.\nReduced Cognitive Load: LLMs handle the linguistic processing, allowing users to focus on their message.\nIncreased Accessibility: LLMs provide a reliable communication tool in various settings.\nAdaptability: LLMs can be integrated with various devices and platforms.\nImproved Quality of Life: Overall, LLMs contribute to a better quality of life by facilitating effective communication.\nAdditional Resources:\nGet a book: https://www.wobblesproject.com/support-us/ \nThe Wobbles Project: https://www.wobblesproject.com/ \nBuy me a coffee: https://buymeacoffee.com/thewobblesproject/ \nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/TheWobblesProject/ \nIntermarketing: https://www.intermarketingza.co.za/\n Our Socials: \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@TheWobblesProject/ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thewobblesproject/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thewobblesproject/\n\n#TheWobblesProject | #WobblesProject | #assistivetech | #FriedreichsAtaxia | #AIforgood | #TechForGood | #GenerativeAI | #AIInnovation | #Intermarketingza | #Intermarketing",

    "title": "CANVAS",
    "description": "Canvas Syndrome Lecture\n\nIntroduction:\nCanvas Syndrome, also known as Cerebellar Ataxia with Neuropathy and Vestibular Areflexia Syndrome (CANVAS), is a rare, progressive neurological disorder characterized by a triad of symptoms affecting balance, coordination, and sensory perception. This lecture will cover its clinical features, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management.\n\n1. Clinical Features:\n • Cerebellar Ataxia:\n • Involves impaired coordination of voluntary movements.\n • Symptoms include gait ataxia, difficulty with fine motor tasks, and tremors.\n • Neuropathy:\n • Peripheral sensory neuropathy, primarily affecting the sensory nerves.\n • Symptoms include numbness, tingling, and loss of sensation in the extremities.\n • Vestibular Areflexia:\n • Loss of vestibular function, leading to balance issues and dizziness.\n • Patients often report unsteadiness, especially in low-light conditions.\n\n2. Pathophysiology:\n • CANVAS is considered a neurodegenerative disorder affecting the cerebellum, peripheral nerves, and vestibular system.\n • The exact cause is unknown, but genetic factors may play a role.\n • Recent studies suggest a potential link to mutations in the RFC1 (Replication Factor C Subunit 1) gene.\n\n3. Diagnosis:\n • Clinical Evaluation:\n • Comprehensive neurological examination to assess ataxia, sensory loss, and vestibular function.\n • Electrophysiological Studies:\n • Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) to evaluate peripheral neuropathy.\n • Vestibular Testing:\n • Video Head Impulse Test (vHIT) and caloric testing to assess vestibular function.\n • Imaging:\n • MRI of the brain to rule out other causes of ataxia and to assess cerebellar atrophy.\n • Genetic Testing:\n • Testing for RFC1 gene mutations if clinically indicated.\n\n4. Differential Diagnosis:\n • Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)\n • Friedreich’s Ataxia\n • Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA)\n • Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)\n\n5. Management:\n • Symptomatic Treatment:\n • Physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve balance and coordination.\n • Vestibular rehabilitation exercises to help with dizziness and balance.\n • Supportive Care:\n • Occupational therapy for daily living adaptations.\n • Orthopedic interventions for neuropathic complications (e.g., foot drop).\n • Medications:\n • No disease-modifying treatments currently available.\n • Medications may be used to manage symptoms like neuropathic pain or tremors.\n\n6. Prognosis:\n • CANVAS is a progressive condition, leading to gradual worsening of symptoms.\n • Life expectancy is typically not significantly reduced, but quality of life may be impacted.\n • Early diagnosis and management can help improve functional outcomes and reduce complications.\n\nConclusion:\nCanvas Syndrome is a complex, multi-system disorder requiring a multidisciplinary approach for effective management. Ongoing research into its genetic basis and potential therapeutic targets holds promise for better future treatments.\n\nReferences:\n • Recent studies on RFC1 mutations and CANVAS.\n • Clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cerebellar ataxias.\n • Rehabilitation strategies for neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions or request further details on specific aspects of CANVAS.",

    "description": "⭐ما هر روز شاهد مبارزه‌ی بیمارانی هستیم که با چالش‌هایی روبه‌رو می‌شوند که برای بسیاری قابل تصور نیست—از سختی در راه رفتن و صحبت کردن تا مشکلات قلبی و تنفسی که زندگی آن‌ها را تهدید می‌کند. در این مستند، بیماران آتاکسی فردریش از رنج‌ها، امیدها و رؤیای زندگی بدون محدودیت می‌گویند.\n\n💊پزشکان نیز درباره‌ی آینده‌ی روشن ژن‌درمانی صحبت می‌کنند—مسیری که می‌تواند این بیماری را از ریشه درمان کند، اما نیازمند سرمایه‌گذاری و توجه فوری است. همچنین، به تنها داروی تأییدشده‌ی این بیماری، اسکایکلاریز (Skyclarys)، اشاره می‌کنند—دارویی که امیدبخش است اما با قیمت بسیار بالا، دور از دسترس بیماران در ایران قرار گرفته است.\n\nاین فقط یک ویدئو نیست؛ یک فریاد است برای دیده شدن، برای حمایت، و برای تغییر! لطفاً این صدا را به گوش دیگران برسانید. ❤️\n#آتاکسی_فردریش\n#آتاکسی\n#بیماری_نادر_ژنتیکی\n#ataxia\n#skyclarys\n#ژن_درمانی",

    "description": "* Ataxias Hereditárias\nAs ataxias de origem genética são geralmente progressivas e podem ser transmitidas de forma dominante ou recessiva. Algumas das mais conhecidas incluem:\n1. Ataxia de Friedreich:\nDoença hereditária autossômica recessiva causada por mutações no gene FXN, responsável pela produção da frataxina, uma proteína essencial para a função mitocondrial. Manifesta-se geralmente entre os 5 e 15 anos de idade, com dificuldade na marcha, perda de reflexos, escoliose e problemas cardíacos.\n2. Ataxias Espinocerebelares (SCA – Spinocerebellar Ataxias): Grupo de doenças genéticas autossômicas dominantes caracterizadas por neurodegeneração progressiva do cerebelo e, em alguns casos, do tronco encefálico e medula espinhal. Os sintomas incluem marcha instável, tremores, dificuldades na fala e nos movimentos oculares.\n3. Ataxia Telangiectasia: Doença genética rara, de herança autossômica recessiva, que afeta múltiplos sistemas. Caracteriza-se por ataxia progressiva na infância, telangiectasias (vasos sanguíneos dilatados visíveis na pele) e deficiência imunológica. Aumenta o risco de infecções e câncer.\n4. Ataxia Episódica: Grupo de doenças genéticas raras causadas por mutações em canais iônicos, resultando em episódios temporários de descoordenação. Os ataques podem ser desencadeados por estresse, fadiga ou exercícios físicos. \n\n#verdecann #marbosmedicinal #cbd #sistemaendocanabinoide #SEC #foryoy #fy #ataxiascerebelares #cedrebro #cerebelo #equilibrio #neurologico #patologias #doencas #autoimunes #qualidadedevida #cabeca #hereditario",

John Pilger interviews Patsy Spybey who sought treatment abroad when she was told there was no hope of recovery from a wasting disease. Despite criticism of her actions, she is now recovering.\n\nFriedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is the name of the condition that Patsy Spybey suffered from, and I vaguely remember looking after some patients in a London hospital with that very debilitating condition. They suffered a lot. \n\nIf you know how things went for Patsy, please leave a comment. It would be very interesting to find out. I hope she is doing ok. Interestingly, I have come across this news report, which, if this is the same person, suggests Spybey was still alive in 2001, but was suffering from cancer and wished to be discharged from hospital, due to multiple cancelled operations, and be allowed to 'die with dignity': https://www.thefreelibrary.com/%27LET+ME+DIE+IN+DIGNITY%27.-a077304234\n\nRE; Video Copyright: John Pilger historically had a deal with UK television bosses, to allow his films be released into the public domain. True to his sentiment, I'm sharing this full film here, and will do so with many of his other most important films too. If you haven't watched any of his films before, they are a must watch. He is one of the - if not THE - greatest documentary filmmakers, and also journalists, of his generation!\n\nRIP John Pilger, you are greatly missed!\n\n*Undistorted Journalism*\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@UndistortedJournalism\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@undistortedjournalism\nX/Twitter: https://twitter.com/UndistortedNews/\n*The Newsical Professor*\nThe Newsical Professor (News/Music Blended) https://www.youtube.com/@TheNewsicalProfessor\nThe Newsical Professor (Music Only): https://www.youtube.com/@TheNewsicalProfessorMusic\n\n#Documentary #documentaries #Pilger #JohnPilger #FriedreichsAtaxia",

    "description": "Welcome to The Wobbles Project, a mission inspired by my journey and driven by a simple yet profound belief: that empowerment and resilience can transform lives, no matter the challenges. I’m Andrew Marshall, and I’ve lived with Friedreich’s Ataxia—a degenerative neuromuscular disorder that has profoundly shaped my life. Yet, my story is about more than this diagnosis. It’s about finding strength, joy, and purpose in sharing my experiences with others.\n\nThrough The Wobbles Project, I’m dedicated to creating a community where support, knowledge, and connection thrive. This initiative is an umbrella over various projects that all aim to make a meaningful impact for people with disabilities, beginning with accessible technology. For so many, devices like tablets open up a world of communication, learning, and independence. It’s my goal to provide this “window into the outside world” for those who might not otherwise have the chance.\n\nThe Wobbles Project encompasses my personal story, my YouTube channel, and a range of future projects—all united in the mission to empower and inspire.\n\nWindows into the Outside World: This is my heart and the first branch to The Wobbles Project. Through this arm, I aim to provide technology to those in need, beginning with tablet donations to kids and adults with disabilities. Technology has been essential to my life, and it’s my goal to pass along the empowerment it brings.\n\nAdditional Resources:\nThe Wobbles Project: https://www.wobblesproject.com/\nThe Wobbles Project Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/TheWobblesProject\nThe Wobbles Project Buy me a coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/TheWobblesProject\nDissecting Wobbles Website: https://www.dissectingwobbles.co.za/\nDissecting Wobbles: https://www.facebook.com/dissectwobbles\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thewobblesproject/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheWobblesProject/\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Dissecting-Wobbles-Thisjustrollebook/dp/B07N19MDNZ\nGoodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40911272-dissecting-wobbles\nJelly Bottle Media: https://www.jellybottlemedia.com/\nMuscular Dystrophy Foundation of South Africa: https://www.mdsa.org.za/\nRare Diseases South Africa: https://www.rarediseases.co.za/\n\n#WindowsIntoTheOutsideWorld | #thewobblesproject | #documentingwobbles | #FAWarrior | #FAHope | #FAAwareness | #FACommunity | #FAFight | #FATech | #FAInspiration | #FAStrong | #FAFamily | #FAAdvocacy | #FriedreichsAtaxia | #FA | #ataxia | #neurodegenerativedisease | #raredisease | #accessibility | #technology | #empowerment | #inspiration | #support | #community",

    "description": "Based on the recommendation of several ABC employees, we decided to try Campo Bravo next.\n\nDue to some nasty, ignorant comments regarding Natalie's disability, we have turned off comments for this video. Natalie has a MA in Arts in Medicine w/undergrad in psychology, a BA, as well as medical degree but has a neuromuscular disease similar to MS. This channel is about our family life, which includes many aspects of our life, our children, gardening, and Friedreich Ataxia (FA). Please check out our playlist on FA here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXEvv8o3ZQ0&list=PLWZk8DFIJWYKBeVmhM1FISUQmpP95THcR&pp=gAQB\n\nand her FA story right here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXEvv8o3ZQ0&list=PLWZk8DFIJWYKBeVmhM1FISUQmpP95THcR\n\nBefore this nasty neurological disease took everything away from Natalie, she walked, ran, drove, lived on her own, and attended school on three separate college compasses, including the University of Florida, worked in the medical field, and worked at UF Health. Ignorant comments will be deleted, and hateful commenters will be deleted from our channel.",

Ella misma dice que uno de sus mayores logros fue aprender a pedir ayuda y aceptarla, también caer sin golpearse. Ama la vida, y considera que las emociones positivas hay que alimentarlas, como todo. Cómo se alimenta al cuerpo, hay que alimentar la mente y regar los vínculos. En pocas palabras, Jazmín se considera una militante de la alegría.\nSu testimonio es inspirador y el trabajo que realiza, además de su solidaridad, compromiso y entrega, deben ser reconocidos. Jazmín Cassandra Lago, tiene 28 años. Estudia la carrera de piano en el Conservatorio de la Provincia. Es presidente de la Fundación Ataxias y otras Neurodegenerativas, y tiene una enfermedad poco frecuente, Ataxia de Friedreich. Pero su enfermedad no la define, aunque ha enriquecido su vida de maneras inesperadas.

    "description": "To uwarunkowana genetycznie, bardzo rzadka, wyniszczająca organizm choroba neurodegeneracyjna. Prowadzi m.in. do stopniowej utraty zdolności poruszania się i mówienia. Objawy rozwijają się zwykle powoli, ale nieuchronnie. Średnia długość życia chorych wynosi tylko 37 lat. \n\nDiagnozę stawia się na podstawie objawów klinicznych, jednak od ich wystąpienia do postawienia prawidłowej diagnozy może minąć wiele lat. Wynika to m.in. z niespecyficznych objawów w przebiegu choroby i pojawienia się czasem jako pierwszych symptomów nieneurologicznych, np. skoliozy czy kardiomiopatii. Takie przejawy Ataksji Friedriecha, jak postępująca utrata koordynacji, osłabienie mięśni i zmęczenie, mogą początkowo sugerować występowanie innych schorzeń.

    "description": "Are you wondering what disabilities qualify for a service dog under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)? In this video, we’ll break down exactly what the ADA says about service dog eligibility, including real-life examples of who would and wouldn’t qualify.\n\n📌 Topics Covered in This Video:\n✅ What the ADA defines as a disability for service dog qualification\n✅ Examples of individuals who would qualify for a service dog\n✅ Examples of individuals who wouldn’t qualify\n✅ Why having both training records & medical documentation is important\n✅ The legal misconception about doctors’ notes & public access\n✅ The difference between service dogs, emotional support animals (ESAs), and therapy dogs\n\nReminders:\n- A doctor’s note is NOT required for public access, but having one before any legal issues arise can protect you.\n- Service dogs MUST be task-trained to assist with a disability that significantly limits major life activities.\n- Emotional support animals (ESAs) are NOT service dogs under federal law.\n- Misusing service dog terms (ESA vs. therapy dog vs. service dog) can cause legal confusion, as well as general confusion for the public. \n\n*Chapters*\n0:00 Introduction\n1:28 What the ADA website says \n3:10 Anxiety Disorders\n4:33 Mobility Disabilities \n5:22 Autism Service Dogs \n6:19 The ADA is Vague on Purpose\n6:42 Am i disabled enough for a service dog? \n7:50 Legal Misconceptions \n8:54 Documentation - why it's important\n9:14 Using the right terminology & why it's important \n11:51 Closing Remarks\n\n📌 🔗 Helpful Resources:\n📖 Read the official ADA guidelines on service dogs → https://www.ada.gov/topics/service-animals/\n🐶 Learn how to train your own service dog → Check out my Service Dog Training Courses: collabdogtraining.com/courses \n\n👩‍🏫 About Me:\nHi, I’m Lisa, a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT-KA), Atlas Assistance Dogs Trainer, and CGC Evaluator.

    "description": "Dr Charles Nduka, surgeon and founder of Emteq Labs, introduces the concept of joyspan- the next metric beyond healthspan. Whereas lifespan measures the duration of life, and healthspan measures the duration of healthy years, joyspan measures the quantity of positive years. The rationale is that there is little point optimising healthspan if it leads to a worse quality of life.\nIn research, the quality of experiences is measured by assessing emotional valence. The most sensitive way to do this is via facial muscle activity, typically with facial electromyography. Charles Nduka invented facial optomyography as a non-contact alternative to allow passive, real-world monitoring of health, mood, dietary behaviours and neurological diseases.\n\nBy partnering with leading researchers, and health partners, Emteq Labs aims to make healthcare precise, predictive, proactive, participatory.\nThis talk was given at the Longevity Summit on 3rd December 2024 at the Buck Institute in California.\n\nhttps://www.emteqlabs.com/\nhttps://longevitygl.org/longevity-summit/",

Se ha identificado en diversas poblaciones sin una distribución geográfica o étnica clara.\n\nDescripción clínica\n\nLa enfermedad se manifiesta principalmente con afectación neurológica progresiva, incluyendo:\n • Retraso en el desarrollo psicomotor, con pérdida de habilidades adquiridas.\n • Ataxia cerebelosa, con dificultades en la coordinación y el equilibrio.\n • Hipotonía y espasticidad, dependiendo de la progresión de la enfermedad.\n • Discapacidad intelectual, de leve a severa.\n • Degeneración óptica y pérdida de la visión en algunos casos.\n • En casos graves, se ha reportado neurodegeneración progresiva con hipoplasia cerebelosa.\n\nEtiología y genética\n\nLa enfermedad es causada por mutaciones en el gen ACO2, ubicado en el cromosoma 22q13.2, que codifica la enzima aconitasa mitocondrial. Esta enzima es fundamental en el ciclo de Krebs, catalizando la conversión del citrato en isocitrato. Su deficiencia provoca disfunción mitocondrial, acumulación de citrato y alteraciones en el metabolismo energético.\n\nEl patrón de herencia es autosómico recesivo, por lo que ambos padres deben ser portadores de una mutación para que su hijo herede la enfermedad.\n\nMétodos de diagnóstico\n • Pruebas bioquímicas:\n • Disminución de la actividad de aconitasa mitocondrial en fibroblastos o tejidos afectados.\n • Acumulación de citrato en plasma y orina.\n • Estudios genéticos:\n • Identificación de mutaciones en el gen ACO2 mediante secuenciación molecular.\n • Neuroimagen (IRM cerebral):\n • Puede mostrar atrofia cerebelosa y signos de neurodegeneración progresiva.\n\nDiagnóstico diferencial\n\nDebe diferenciarse de otros trastornos neurometabólicos con afectación cerebelosa, tales como:\n • Enfermedades mitocondriales (mutaciones en genes como POLG o SURF1).\n • Ataxias hereditarias, incluyendo ataxia de Friedreich.\n • Síndromes neurodegenerativos con hipoplasia cerebelosa, como el síndrome de Joubert.\n\nAsesoramiento genético\n\nDado que se hereda de manera autosómica recesiva, los padres de un niño afectado son portadores asintomáticos. Se recomienda pruebas genéticas para familiares y diagnóstico prenatal en embarazos con riesgo conocido.\n\nManejo y tratamiento\n\nActualmente, no existe un tratamiento curativo para la deficiencia de aconitasa mitocondrial. El manejo es sintomático y de soporte:\n • Fisioterapia y terapia ocupacional para mejorar la movilidad y el control motor.\n • Soporte nutricional, incluyendo dietas adaptadas a las necesidades metabólicas del paciente.\n • Tratamiento sintomático para la espasticidad y la ataxia.\n • Monitoreo oftalmológico y neurológico regular.\n\nPronóstico\n\nEl pronóstico varía según la gravedad de la enfermedad. En los casos más severos, la neurodegeneración progresiva puede llevar a una discapacidad grave y reducción en la expectativa de vida. Sin embargo, en formas más leves, los pacientes pueden presentar una progresión más lenta con manejo sintomático adecuado.\n\nOMIM: 100850\n\nReferencias bibliográficas\n 1. Saudubray, J.

    "description": "O Governo de Minas Gerais e Museu Inimá de Paula apresenta a exposição “Expressões de Afeto” de Mário Nelson Nepomuceno Bracarense em cartaz do dia 22 de Novembro de 2024 a 23 de Fevereiro de 2025.\n\nMário Nelson Nepomuceno Bracarense nasceu em Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais no ano de 1991. Teve uma infância amorosa e normal, mas no início da adolescência apresentou alguns problemas de coordenação motora. Aos 20 anos, já diagnosticado com Ataxia de Friedreich, doença degenerativa que compromete a coordenação motora e força muscular, começou a se locomover por cadeiras de rodas. Esse momento de mudança contribuiu para que Mário explorasse a escultura em argila, dando forma a cabeças e rostos que, de maneira visceral, refletem suas próprias vivências e emoções. Através da imperfeição e da intensidade das expressões faciais, o artista construiu uma conexão emocional com seu público, criando um elo entre sua presença física, gestos e materialidade.\n\nA mostra “Expressões de Afeto” é uma homenagem à mãe do artista, Sílvia Barral, que convida o espectador a mergulhar pelo universo expressivo de Nelson. As 35 esculturas apresentadas são um retrato do afeto humano, capaz de transmitir uma vasta gama de sentimentos – da dor à felicidade, da angústia à serenidade. A produção de Mário Nelson nos leva a um diálogo profundo sobre o poder transformador da arte. Suas obras não apenas capturam o instante da expressão, mas também a narrativa da vida do próprio artista, em sua superação.\n\nMuseu Inimá de Paula - Rua da Bahia, 1.201, Centro, Belo Horizonte - MG, 30160-011\nSaiba mais nas redes sociais do museu:\nYoutube: @museuinimadepaula17 \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/museuinimadepaula\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/museuinimadepaula/\n-",
